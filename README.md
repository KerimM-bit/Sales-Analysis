# Sales-Analysis
## In this project with the data I have I tried analyze it  based on real world scenerios which includes:
### 1. Type and number of products sold in states
### 2. Time-series analysis, trying to find which months have most most sales in the states
### 3. Lastly, finding sales pattern based on different time periods (namely: weeks and months)

Before starting to answer these questions as in every other data analysis,  first step was EDA (I'll be brief as mush as possible).

#### 1. Dealing with null values (if there is any)
#### 2. Checking data types of columns, for later calculations
#### 3. Data featuring

## 1. Type and number of products sold in states
For visualisation I tried matplotlib in order to have basic idea how sales distributed between states given in dataset. Later I switch to plotly for better visualisation and interactivity.

## 2. Time-series analysis, trying to find which months have most most sales in the states

In this chart there are a lot of information which can be used, after few trial and error I decided to go with charts which can be filtered by user.

## 3. Lastly, finding sales pattern based on different time periods (namely: weeks and months)
This time I tried to compare weekly and monthly sales in order to see, if there are patterns to be exploited.

## Bonus part
 Really lastly, my goal was to find increase and decrease on sales for every product over time period (day in this case)
